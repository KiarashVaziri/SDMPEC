# Simulator and Diagram Maker Program for Electric Circuits
## Introduction
Our project is a SPICE-inspired simulator written in Java. The program takes a text file which contains all the circuit nodes and components labeled according to specific rules. By using Nodal Analysis, the program solves the circuit for each time step and sets a voltage value for each node. Our program can simulate circuits including elements such as resistor, capacitor, inductor, voltage source (DC and Sinusoidal), current source (DC and Sinusoidal), and linear dependent sources. Other than simulating, the program is able to draw a circuit based on the input text file.
